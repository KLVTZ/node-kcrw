# node-kcrw

Play the KCRW live stream in your Terminal. Because why not.  
Made mostly possibe by [node-lame](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-speaker) and [node-speaker](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-speaker).

## Install

With [npm](https://npmjs.org) do (you may need sudo):

```
npm install -g kcrw
```

## Usage

Play KCRW:

```
$ kcrw
```

## Notes

Haven't tested on Windows. Would like to add KCRW's 24/7 streams (both news & music to be played via command line args).
